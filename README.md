# rough-circumference-of-a-Mandelbrot-Set-fractal rough circumference of a Mandelbrot Set fractal using function approximation (bisection, polynomial, integration). 
This MATLAB project approximates the Mandelbrot set boundary using the bisection algorithm, polynomial fitting, and arc-length integration. The program first applies a divergence test to identify inside and outside points, then uses bisection to locate the boundary across vertical slices of the complex plane. A degree-15 polynomial is fitted to the extracted boundary points, and MATLAB’s integral function is used to compute the arc length of the fitted curve. For the interval [−2,0], the estimated boundary length is about 5.40. While the true Mandelbrot boundary is infinitely long, this method provides a smoothed numerical approximation and demonstrates how classical numerical tools can be applied to complex fractal geometry.
